                                        My four years at Vel Tech were a journey of discovery, transformation, 
                                        and connection. From the first day I stepped onto campus, I was filled
                                         with a sense of wonder and excitement about the endless possibilities 
                                         that awaited me in the field of computer science. <br>The vibrant atmosphere
                                          of the college encouraged me to explore new ideas and perspectives. 
                                          Engaging in discussions with classmates and professors opened my 
                                          eyes to diverse viewpoints and innovative ways of thinking. These 
                                          interactions not only enriched my understanding of technology but 
                                          also helped me build lasting friend ships that I cherish to this day.<br> 
                                          Throughout my academic journey, I learned the value of collaboration 
                                          and the importance of teamwork. Taking on leadership roles in group 
                                          projects taught me how to listen, empathize, and foster an inclusive 
                                          environment where everyone's ideas were valued. This experience shaped 
                                          my ability to work effectively with others and instilled in me a deep 
                                          appreciation for collective creativity. <br>Beyond the academics, I embraced 
                                          the opportunities that campus life offered, participating in various 
                                          extracurricular activities that nurtured my passions. Whether it was 
                                          engaging in cultural events or joining clubs, each experience contributed
                                           to my personal growth and helped me discover my interests outside the 
                                           classroom. <br>As I graduated, I carried with me not just a solid academic 
                                           foundation, but also a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to 
                                           lifelong learning. My time at Vel Tech has prepared me to face the future w
                                           ith confidence, ready to make a meaningful impact through technology and
                                            innovation.

                                        Agriculture is a critical sector, especially in countries like India where
                                     a large portion of the population depends on farming. However, plant 
                                     diseases pose significant threats to crop yield and quality, leading 
                                 to substantial economic losses. Traditional methods of disease 
                                 detection, which rely on visual observation by farmers and experts, 
                             are often time-consuming, expensive, and prone to inaccuracies. 
                         In response, this project proposes an automatic plant disease recognition 
                            model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By utilizing advanced 
                                image processing techniques, the model classifies leaf images to accurately 
                                 differentiate between healthy and diseased plants. Leveraging a custom dataset 
                                    of diverse plant leaves, this CNN-based system significantly improves the speed 
                                     and precision of disease detection. Early detection of plant diseases not only 
                                     enhances agricultural productivity but also contributes to the sustainability of 
                                     food supply and the economy. This project underscores the potential of computer
                                         vision and CNN applications in precision agriculture, offering a modern and 
                                         efficient alternative to traditional plant disease diagnosis.

                                    heart, nerves and kidney. One important complication is DR. 
                                    The mechanized methods for DR recognition are flexible for 
                                    cost and time reduction and are more competent over manual analysis. 
                                    Deep Learning technique performs computer aided medical diagnosis. 
                                    This paper is an attempt toward finding an automatic solution for Diabetic Retinopathy
                                     disease in initial stage. Using Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning, 
                                     doctors can find blind- ness before it happens. In this project we are using
                                      supervised learning approach to perform classification on fundus images. 
                                      For this task we are employing several image processing procedures 
                                      and filters to improve many significant features like microaneurysm, 
                                      hemorrhages, exudates, swollen blood vessels which are the features of 
                                      fundus image that imply that particular person has Diabetic Retinopathy 
                                      and then using neural networks for classification. This classifies the
                                       fundus images with an accuracy of 82 percent by using CNN architecture.
